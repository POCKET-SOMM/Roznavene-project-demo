The classic Madeira styles can also be discerned by their level of sweetness: sercial is dry, verdelho medium-dry, bual medium-sweet and malvasia sweet. Madeira has the longest shelf life of all wine types: once opened, it can keep for several months.","Madeira is a flexible wine that can be used for socialising, as an aperitif, with appetisers and desserts, depending on the Madeira type. 
Madeira is a great aperitif and a perfect wine for socialising. Dry Madeira wines are also a classic match for food, especially soups and broths.

The classic Madeira styles can also be discerned by their level of sweetness: sercial is dry, verdelho medium-dry, bual medium-sweet and malvasia sweet. Madeira has the longest shelf life of all wine types: once opened, it can keep for several months.","Madeira is a flexible wine that can be used for socialising, as an aperitif, with appetisers and desserts, depending on the Madeira type. 
Madeira is a great aperitif and a perfect wine for socialising. Dry Madeira wines are also a classic match for food, especially soups and broths.

The classic Madeira styles can also be discerned by their level of sweetness: sercial is dry, verdelho medium-dry, bual medium-sweet and malvasia sweet.
